# Machine learning with Julia


_Note_: Please copy `Manifest.toml.julialang` to `Manifest.toml` before starting if you are using the Julia runtime from https://julialang.org/downloads. 
The default Manifest.toml is built to work with [JuliaPro](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro) only. If you get an error about `CredentialsHandler` or `TOML`, that means you are running with the wrong manifest.
